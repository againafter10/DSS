This directory includes scripts to simulate Concurrent Manager load for 
OAM 11i demos.



Concurrent Manager Load
-----------------------

1. Setup:  

   These steps only need to be completed once, unless the database 
   is refreshed to some previous state.


   A. Run seed110.sql to create the concurrent program definitions required 
      by the demo.
  
         sqlplus apps/apps@my_db @seed110


   B. Run the buildview command to rebuild the worker view.

         buildview apps/apps@my_db


2. Purging Requests: 

   You may want to purge the request data before your demo.  For demos, we
   like to use higher refresh rates than would be practical in the real world.
   The less data that the data gatherer has to sort through, the smoother
   the demo will run.

   The script "purge" will submit a concurrent request to purge request 
   data. This request could take hours to complete, depending on the amount of
   data in your system.

      purge apps/apps@my_db


3. Starting the Load:

   The "simulated" load submits requests for PL/SQL Concurrent Programs which
   sleep while they are in the "Running" state.  Thus your system can appear
   to have many running requests with minimal resource consumption.

   The script submit.sql can be run to submit demo jobs.  The effects of this
   script are cumulative, multiple runs will increase the load.

      sqlplus apps/apps@my_db @submit

   The script submiti.sql will submit a set of incompatible programs, one of
   which will run for 12 hours.  The purpose of this script is to guarantee 
   that the user SYSADMIN will have a "Standby" request called "Purge Program
   Statistics" for which there will be entries in the "Requests Waited On"
   chart. 

      sqlplus apps/apps@my_db @submiti


4. Stopping the Load:

   The script stopall.sql will stop all of the concurrent requests submitted
   by the submit.sql and submiti.sql scripts.  Due to race conditions, it
   might be necessary to run this script more than once to bring down all
   of the requests.

       sqlplus apps/apps@my_db @stopall
